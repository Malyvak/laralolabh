                A passionate creative and lifelong follower of the arts, my first editing employment was during high school - 
                work which would grow into both passion and aspiration throughout the rest of my education and beyond.

                Having worked across various fields within Brisbane/Meanjin's creative scene and graduated Film School with 
                a bachelor of Film and Screen Media, I have gained a broad skillset in marketing and advertising;
                design and branding; digital and emerging media; film production; and visual arts, to name a few, specialising 
                in video editing. This love of editing has brought me regular freelance and contracting work; in-house editing 
                positions; as well as work for local productions including collaboration with Screen Queensland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have gained an excellent work ethic and hands-on practical knowledge of teamwork, managerial 
                duties, and the intricacies of navigating and furthering the arts in a rocky economy, through my diversity of 
                work in filmmaking and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things I am most proud of is my work with enterprises focusing on the support and empowerment of 
                girls and women, both locally and Australia-wide. For the past seven years I have been creating content for 
                businesses and not-for-profits within this area, which include <i>Trellis Collective</i>, 
                <i>UNIQ You, Girl Shaped Flames,</i> and <i>The Centre for Women & Co.</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the side, I spend my time assisting on various sets, holding art exhibitions, hosting painting classes, 
                teaching, and making visual arts commissions.

                    I have been working for myself for over seven years now in the media and marketing field, primarily as a
                    video editor and post-production artist, however regularly delving into branding; copywriting; graphic
                    design; animation; content strategy; and hands-on video production from the ground up. A few of my
                    favourite clients over the years include Hollywood stunt artist Ky Furneaux; the Summer Solstice festival;
                    and various local musicians. These jobs have spanned from highly focused corporate marketing to free-reining 
                    creative works, a spectrum that I tailor to day by day based on the clients' needs.
