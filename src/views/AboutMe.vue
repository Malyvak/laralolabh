                    So far I've spent all my work time, downtime, and everything in between chasing the arts, 
                    and I look forward to continuing to do so in new and different ways every day.

                    On the weekend you might find me photographing for local gigs, hosting painting classes, 
                    restoring headstones, holding local art exhibitions, or dodgily silversmithing. 
                    I'll never have a nice manicure but I doubt I'll ever be boredâ€¦
